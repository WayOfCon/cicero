Cicero: Serving presentation slides written in Markdown
=======================================================

You **write your talk in Markdown**, host it on
`GitHub <https://github.com>`__
or
`GitLab <https://gitlab.com>`__.
**We render it** using
`remark <https://remarkjs.com>`__
of
`reveal.js <https://revealjs.com>`__
and serve it for you
before you can say blueberry pie.
You can **style your slides** to your heart's content.
