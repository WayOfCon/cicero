How to customize everything
===========================

You want to change looks and fonts? CSS is not enough? Perhaps you need an
external JavaScript library?

You can place ``*.head.html`` and/or ``*.body.html`` alongside your ``*.md`` slides.
In these files you can do and change almost everything:

To get inspired of what is in these by default and what can be changed, please
